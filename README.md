My attempts to complete various coding assignments from 6.0002 - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science.

PS1 is code which implements two different algorithms (brute force or greedy) to find the optimal solution for how one may trasport a given number of cows through space.

PS2 Uses a monte carlo search algorithm to find a the shortest route through a digraph which in this case is a map of MIT.

PS4 attempts to simulate the growth of bacteria with and without antibiotics.
